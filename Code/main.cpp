/*
The DNA molecule is composed of two chains of nucleotides, each composed of one
of four bases: cytosine (which we will denote by the single character 'C'),
guanine (denoted by 'G'), adenine (denoted by 'A') or thymine (denoted by 'T').
In this Lab you are going to complete a program which will generate a random DNA
sequence (i.e. a string of the letter bases - eg. "ACTTCAGG") assuming a uniform
distribution of each letter.
I kinda had randomly picked the uniform distribution but it was actually
required, welp. Anywho my implementaion only uses the 4 characters that he
said^^^^^ sooooo the input seed for the bases is useless and i removed it
